METHOD Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Peel the onion and garlic and finely dice. Add both the chickpeas, onion and garlic to the food processor along with the rest of the ingredients. Pulse until they come together but not too much as you want to ensure to keep some texture. Remove from the food processor and add to a large bowl. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your liking, add more spices if you prefer a hotter falafel. Shape the falafel into small balls using your clean hands. Its important that you compress them so that they stay together when cooking. Heat a Non stick pan on high heat and add 3 tbsp of oil, once hot carefully add the falafels and fry on each side until nice and golden brown For the herby salad just finely dice the onion, cucumber and herbs. Mix together with the oil and salt and season to your taste. Serve on a flat bread with hummus, with the herby salad and some chilli sauce Enjoy!
